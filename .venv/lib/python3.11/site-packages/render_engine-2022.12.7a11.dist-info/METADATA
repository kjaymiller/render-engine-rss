> ***Warning***
> Render Engine 2022.12.3 introduced a change to the schema where now the following commands were changed. I apologize for any inconvenience.
> - `render_page` is just `page`
> - `render_collection` is just `collection`
> - You will need to now add `site.render()` where `site` is your `Site` instance

## What is RenderEngine
## The _3 layer_ Architecture 

* **[Page](.github/render_engine/page.html)** - A single webpage item built from content, a template, raw data, or a combination of those things.
* **[Collection](.github/render_engine/collection.html)** - A group of webpages built from the same template, organized in a single directory
* **[Site](.github/render_engine/site.html)** - The container that helps to render all Pages and Collections in with uniform settigns and variables
